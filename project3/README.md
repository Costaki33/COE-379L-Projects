# Hurricane Harvey Damage Prediction with the Use of Neural Networks 

The repository focuses on classifying different satellite images from the Hurricane Harvey disaster. We are seeking to classify houses if they are "damaged" or "not damaged" using TensorFlow-based Neural Networks. We explored 3 different models: Artificial Neural Network, LeNet-5 & Alternate LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Networks. We deployed the NN's using a Flask-based inference server for you the user to interact with. 

Note: Not all models have been uploaded to Github as they exceed the max file-upload size that it can take.
