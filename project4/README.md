# Family Facial Recognition for Home Security Applications

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can help us identify a familiar face at a residence or a stranger who may be a source of suspicion. The model will be trained on pictures of Costakiâ€™s family members who live at his house as well as a dataset of strangers who do not live at his house. Our goal is for our models to accurately and efficiently tell us who the specific family member is or if it is a stranger.
